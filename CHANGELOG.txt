v0.3 -- Bugfixes:
 - One can now read from a device from /dev;
  `- The stat() syscall returns a *null size* (0) for these devices and
     dislocker used this size to tell the partition's size, which induced to
     present a zero-length NTFS file hence this bug.
 - Code cleaned and reorganised (yes, it's a bugfix);
 - Better BitLocker's files handling. This is not optimal yet, as it involved
   the NTFS layer, which is completely dislocker-independant, currently.
  
     -- Features improvement:
 - One can write on a BitLocker encrypted volume;
 - Adding `--readonly' arguments to deny writes on the BitLocker volume;
 - Default verbosity to CRITICAL level instead of QUIET, hence the `--quiet'
   option was added.


v0.2 -- Features improvement:
 - Now also able to decrypt/read BitLocker encrypted partitions from Windows
   Vista;
 - Better arguments handling (added verbosity and logging redirection);
 - Now able to pass an offset for the beginning of the partition (useful when
   all the disk has been copied instead of the partition);
 - Rules added into the Makefile: "make file" and "make fuse" to make binaries
   for using with FUSE or decrypting in a different file.

     -- Portability:
 - Support added for MacOSX (using osxfuse, tested on Snow Leopard).


v0.1 -- Features:
 - Decrypt BitLocker encrypted partitions from Windows 7 only;
 - A FUSE module is available for reading partitions;
 - Possibility to decrypt the entire partition into a file.
