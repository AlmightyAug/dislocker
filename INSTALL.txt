INTRODUCTION
`------------

This file describes how to install dislocker onto your machine.



REQUIREMENTS
`------------

You need:
 - Headers for FUSE, if you want to use FUSE;
 - Headers for PolarSSL;
 - A partition encrypted with BitLocker, from Windows Vista, 7 or 8.

For Debian-like:
  aptitude install libfuse-dev libpolarssl-dev
For Fedora-like:
  yum install fuse-devel polarssl-devel
For OSX: Follow the instructions in the next section.

Of course, you also need a compiler like gcc or clang, and make.

Note that the code expects FUSE 2.6, when using the decryption with FUSE.



INSTALLING
`----------

First thing to do is to cd into the src/ directory. Then, each OS type has its
own section below, beware to follow yours:

. If you are on MacOSX, just install Homebrew (http://brew.sh/) and run the
following command:
$ brew install dislocker.rb
This will install dislocker in FUSE mode.

. If you're on FreeBSD, run the following commands for installing the required
libraries:
$ pkg install polarssl
$ pkg install gmake
$ pkg install fusefs-libs
Then follow the instructions below (next point):

. If you aren't on MacOSX...
As you may know, the driver can be used in two ways: using FUSE or not. By
default, typing `make` will generate a FUSE capable binary. However, running
`make file` won't include FUSE capabilities. In this latter mode, dislocker
will decrypt your BitLocker volume into a file, so make sure you have enough
space left on your partition. The file will be a NTFS partition then.
Thus, make your choice of the use you'll have.

Type: `make` or `make file` according to your needs, then `sudo make install`
(or just the last one if you're lazy, but I don't recommend that). Note that the
`-Werror' flag on the `WFLAGS' line in the Makefile may break the compilation,
so you can remove it, but it is at your own risks.

The binary will be installed into `/usr/bin/' by default, edit the INSTALL_PATH
variable (into the Makefile) to change that before the `make install` command.

Once installed, see dislocker(1) for details on how to use it.



UNINSTALLING
`------------

I'm sure you don't want to do that. But if you're really forced by someone, just
type `make uninstall`.



PORTABILITY
`-----------

Globally, this was successfuly tested on Linux x86/x86_64, MacOSX and FreeBSD.
It won't work on Windows and may not work on other BSDs.

For MacOSX, it has been tested against OSXFUSE 2.3.8 and 2.3.9.

Whether it works or not, feel free to send comments and feedbacks to
<dislocker __AT__ hsc __DOT__ fr>.

Thanks goes to Rogier Wolff for testing, hugsy for all the OSX support, and all
the people who give feedbacks.



NOTE
`----

Two more binaries are build when compiling dislocker:
- One for disecting a .bek file and printing information about it;
- The other one for printing information about a BitLocker-encrypted volume.
